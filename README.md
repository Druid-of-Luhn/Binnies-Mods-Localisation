# Binnie's Mods Localisation
Localisation for Binnie's Mods. Accepting any language updates or spelling fixes to existing localisations.

## Bee, Tree and Flower Descriptions
In the registry there are short descriptions, sometimes amusing, about each species, along with a source of the description. These can be found in the corresponding localisation files, and I welcome pull requests adding descriptions to species that are currently lacking. I reserve the right to tweak them a little bit however.
